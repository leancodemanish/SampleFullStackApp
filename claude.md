## Workflow
1. First, think through the problem. Read the codebase, create a new file under claude-guide with appropriate short name and cross check with me what name I want to give.
2. Create a .md file and write a plan in as tasks/todo in that file.
3. The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
4. Check in with me before starting work—I'll verify the plan.
5. Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
6. At every step, give me a high-level explanation of what you changed.
7. Keep every change simple and minimal. Avoid big rewrites.
8. At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
9. I do not want comments in the code, I will add where I see appropriate.
10. Go through the code you just wrote and confirm it follows security best practices. Check that no sensitive data is left in the frontend, and that there are no vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.
